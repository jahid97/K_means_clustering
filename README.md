# K-Means Clustering Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates the **K-Means Clustering** algorithm, which is a popular unsupervised machine learning technique used for data grouping or segmentation. K-Means is widely applied in data analysis tasks, including customer segmentation, anomaly detection, and image compression. This implementation allows users to apply K-Means to their own datasets, visualize the results, and gain insights into the structure of the data.

The project includes:
- A Python-based implementation of the K-Means algorithm.
- Tools for clustering data points into \(K\) distinct groups.
- Visualization of the clusters to assist with the analysis.


## Purpose
The primary objectives of this project are:
- To perform K-Means Clustering on a given dataset.
- To provide a clear and understandable visualization of the resulting clusters.
- To allow for easy adjustment of parameters (e.g., the number of clusters).

## Features
- Custom K-Means Clustering algorithm.
- Visualizes data clusters using Matplotlib.
- Supports different datasets and allows adjusting the number of clusters \(K\).
- Option to export clustering results.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/K_means_clustering.git
   cd K_means_clustering
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:  
   Ensure Python is installed, then install the necessary libraries.
   ```bash
   pip install numpy matplotlib pandas scikit-learn
   ```

3. **Run the script**:
   ```bash
   python k_means_clustering.py
   ```

## Usage
1. Place your dataset (CSV or other supported formats) in the project directory.
2. Adjust parameters like the number of clusters \(K\) or the input file path within the script.
3. Run the script to see clustering results and visualizations.

### Example
Hereâ€™s an example of how to use the script:
```bash
python k_means_clustering.py --input data.csv --clusters 3
```

## Results
- Outputs a visualization showing clustered data points and centroids.
- Generates a summary of the clustering analysis.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Pandas
- (Optional) Scikit-learn (for comparison with built-in KMeans)
